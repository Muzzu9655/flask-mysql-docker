# 🚀 Dockerized Flask + MySQL Without Docker Compose

This project demonstrates how I connected a Flask app and a MySQL database using **plain Docker commands**, step by step — no Docker Compose involved.

---

## 🔧 What I Did

- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Flask app  
- Used `requirements.txt` to install dependencies  
- Set up a **custom Docker network** so containers could talk  
- Ran a MySQL container manually  
- Connected Flask to MySQL using `pymysql`

---

## 🐳 Commands I Used

---

### 1️⃣ Build Flask Image

```bash
docker build -t flask-app .
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create Docker Network

```bash
docker network create flask-net
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run MySQL Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mysql-db \
  --network flask-net \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb \
  -e MYSQL_USER=testuser \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=testpass \
  mysql:5.7
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run Flask Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name flask-app \
  --network flask-net \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  flask-app
```

---

## ✅ Output

When visiting `http://localhost:5000`, you should see:

```
✅ Connected to MySQL from Flask!
```

If there's an error, Flask will show the exact connection issue for debugging.

## 💡 Why This Was Valuable

Doing everything manually helped me:

- Understand how Docker networks work  
- Get better with writing Dockerfiles  
- Learn how containers communicate without Compose.
